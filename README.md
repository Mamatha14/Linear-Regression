# Linear-Regression

### Problem Statement:
Understanding the demand of using shared bikes, factors affecting the same, variables significant in predicting the demand and how significant it is.

### Steps Involved:
1. EDA on the Bike sharing data set.
2. Data Preparation for Modeling: 
    - Creating dummies for the categorical variables.
    - Creating train/test split
    - Scaling
3. Model Building: 
    - Use of Linear Regression to build the predicted model.
    - Use of RFE+manual feature elimination for feature selections. 
    - Build multiple models on train set and arriving at final model with the  help of p-value and VIF
4. Model Evaluation: Prediction on test set and evaluating the model with the help of R2-score.
